        <p>Thank you for visiting my page.
            I arrived in Belgium in August 2018 as an Au Pair. 
            It has always been my dream to obatain European degree, then, I have decided to study Business Management at the UCLL.
            I am on my second year now. 
            I am outgoing, dedicated, and open-minded. I get across to people and adjust to changes with ease. 
            I believe that a person should work on developing their professional skills and learning new things all the time.

            Maybe you are wondering, where do I came from?
            I'm a proud Indonesian, coming from  musical family of 5.
            I am the youngest and I'm 27yo.

            Currently, I start my journey in Hack Your Future Belgium.
            I am new in the world of coding, but I am excited to learn new things everyday.
            My future is in my hand, and I believe in myself.
