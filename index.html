        <p>Thank you for visiting my page.
            I arrived in Belgium in August 2018 as an Au Pair. 
            It has always been my dream to obtain European degree, then, I have decided to study Business Management at the UCLL.
            I am on my second year now. 
            I am outgoing, dedicated, and open-minded. I get across to people and adjust to changes with ease. 
            I believe that a person should work on developing their professional skills and learning new things all the time.

            Maybe you are wondering, where do I came from?
            I'm a proud Indonesian. Indonesia is situated in South East Asia. I recommend you to go there. 
            We have lots of beautiful places, such as <a href="https://bali.com/" target="_blank">Bali</a> , <a href="https://www.indonesia.travel/gb/en/destinations/maluku-papua/raja-ampat" target="_blank">Raja Ampat</a> ,
            and <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/news/2014/1/140130-kawah-ijen-blue-flame-volcanoes-sulfur-indonesia-pictures/" target="_blank">Ijen Crater</a>.
            About my family, I'm coming from  musical family of 5. I love my family, they are my motivation and I dedicated my work for them.
            I am the youngest and I'm 27yo. Fun fact: we once had 6 dogs, and it was awesome.

            Currently, I start my journey in Hack Your Future Belgium.
            I am new in the world of coding, but I am excited to learn new things everyday.
            My dream is to be a great programmer. I want to create useful and beautiful things that would help everybody.
            And in the essence of creating something helpful, there is a profound joy.
            
            My future is in my hand, and I believe in myself.
