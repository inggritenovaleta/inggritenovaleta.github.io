        <h1>Hi, there!</h1>
        <h2>I'm Inggrit.</h2>

        <p>Thank you for visiting my page.
            I have been living in Belgium for 2 and a half year. 
            Currently, I study Business Management at the UCLL.
            I am outgoing, dedicated, and open-minded. I get across to people and adjust to changes with ease. 
            I believe that a person should work on developing their professional skills and learning new things all the time.
        </p>
        <p>
            Maybe you are wondering, where do I came from?
            I'm a proud Indonesian, coming from  musical family of 5.
            I am the youngest and I'm 27yo.

            Currently, I start my journey in Hack Your Future Belgium.
            I am new in the world of coding, but I am excited in learning new things everyday.
            My future is in my hand, and I believe in myself.
